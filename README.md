Hi, I’m Justin Chan, a Civil Engineering Student at UC Berkeley looking for construction technology/data science internships or research opportunities! I've recently gotten into coding and data science due to some of the classes required for my data science minor!

I'm currently interested in games, data analytics, software developement, and construction processes and how to make them more efficient through data analysis! Currently, I'm proficient in Python, R, Matlab, SQL, and the office suite! I'm looking to expand my knowledge of coding languages, learn as much as I can, and improve on the things that I already know.

You can reach me through Linkedin or email!
